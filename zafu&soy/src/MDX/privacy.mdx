<p><strong>Using Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We use your personal Information to provide our services to you, which includes: offering products for sale, processing payments, shipping and fulfillment of your order, and keeping you up to date on new products, services, and offers.</p>

<p><strong>Lawful basis</strong></p>
<p>Pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we process your personal information under the following lawful bases:</p>

<p>Your consent;</p>
<p>The performance of the contract between you and the Site;</p>
<p>Compliance with our legal obligations;</p>
<p>To protect your vital interests;</p>
<p>To perform a task carried out in the public interest;</p>
<p>For our legitimate interests, which do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

<p>When you place an order through the Site, we will retain your Personal Information for our records unless and until you ask us to erase this information. For more information on your right of erasure, please see the ‘Your rights’ section below.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic decision-making</strong></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to object to processing based solely on automated decision-making (which includes profiling), when that decision-making has a legal effect on you or otherwise significantly affects you.</p>
<p>We do not engage in fully automated decision-making that has a legal or otherwise significant effect using customer data.</p>

<p>Your Personal Information will be initially processed in Ireland and then will be transferred outside of Europe for storage and further processing, including to Canada and the United States.
