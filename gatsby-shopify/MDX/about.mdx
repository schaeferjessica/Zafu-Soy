<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>ZAKKA was born from our curiosity and fascination for the Japanese design and craftsmanship. We explore the culture with a foreigner perspective, in different from the local people who live in their own culture. “ZAKKA” ( 雑貨 in Japanese ) describes the object that people use on a daily basis. In addition to the appearance and function, it is also sustainable and meant to grow with us and optimize the overall life.</p>
